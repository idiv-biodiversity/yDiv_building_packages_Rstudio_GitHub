# Introduction

Initial blabla about building and checks

# Build the package


# Check the package

Building seems to have worked! But let's make sure that everything has been set up properly.


# Exercise

1. Run R CMD check on your package
2. Build your package
3. commit and push to GitHub



```{r, eval=FALSE}
check()
#> ── R CMD check results ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── myPackage 0.0.0.9000 ────
#> Duration: 14.2s
#> 
#> ❯ checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... WARNING
#>   Non-standard license specification:

#> ❯ checking for missing documentation entries ... WARNING
#>   Undocumented code objects:
#>     ‘greet’
#>   All user-level objects in a package should have documentation entries.
