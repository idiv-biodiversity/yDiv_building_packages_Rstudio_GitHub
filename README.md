# yDiv - Building R-packages with R-Studio and GitHub

## Background and Motivation
R is a widely used tool for data analyses in ecology.
Part of its success is due to the active community and the wide array of add-on packages contributed by scientists from across disciplines, via the CRAN network.
R packages are an excellent and standardize way to distribute code and data to a huge community, and a great tool to ensure reproducible research.

## Objectives
After this course, students will be able to

1.	use up-to-date methodology to provide R code and data as R-package
2.	to write, document and test R packages for submission to CRAN
3.	use common tools for packaging, including roxygen2, devtools, testthat, and GitHub

## Content
The course guides through the process of building and R package starting from conceptualization to testing.
The course consists of introductory demonstrations coupled with hands-on exercises on the different stages of package building, plus time to work on a small example.

## Course level and requirements
This is a course for graduate students and researchers that routinely use R for analysis and want to learn how to distribute data and code as R package.
