# Introduction

Vignettes are a R's version of longer format documentation. You can for example use them to demonstrate an example workflow. The major difference of vignettes to the function help is, that you do not need to know any function name, but the vignette will instead explain how to use your package to solve a particular problem. 

# Markdown
You can write vignettes relatively easily in R Markdown, which is basically a version of markdown which can directly include code. Markdown is a really easy language to learn and it will not take you more than 5 minutes to understand the basic way it works. You can find a really helpful summary in this [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).
